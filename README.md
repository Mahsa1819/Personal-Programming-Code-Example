# Personal Programming Code Examples

This project is related to **vibration analysis**, where students are provided with a diagram image and are required to analyze the system in MATLAB. The project includes personal programming examples focused on simulating forced and free oscillations in various systems, including rectangular, step, and sinusoidal inputs. These examples demonstrate my ability to solve differential equations and simulate dynamic systems using MATLAB.

## üìä Output

- **Plots** of:
  - Displacement, velocity, and acceleration as functions of time
  - Forced and free vibration in response to different inputs
  - Frequency responses and system behavior under different excitation forces

---

## üìå Notes

- The simulations are based on solving second-order differential equations using numerical methods in MATLAB.
- Depending on the system's parameters, different behaviors such as resonance, damping, and frequency response can be observed.
